164
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,600
So, del e o j, before that let me write
this.

165
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:20,580
So, this is e of the output o j is equal to
this error is dependent on or rather write

166
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:33,820
let me just write it in a proper way. It is
other way round. So, this error at the unit

167
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:44,120
o j has come from the units which are upstream
of o j. If you allow let me rub this part,

168
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:54,760
so that we can make the drawing here.
So, this is my the unit j and j has certain

169
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:07,600
input which we have already seen, but j outputs
to the next layer, and

170
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:18,340
let the output of j go to the input of these
units and let us call this set of nodes z.

171
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:28,960
And let set say that z comprises of z 1, z
2, etcetera, or just for simplicity let me

172
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:45,289
denote it for this step as 1 2 l. These are
the nodes to which the output of j is feeding.

173
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:55,600
During back propagation the error of these
nodes is due to the error here. So, the error

174
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:11,760
of o j is based on error of net z 1 net z
2 net z 3, or for simplicity let me write

175
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:31,120
net 1, net 2, etcetera net l by del o j.

176
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:43,039
So, these components due to net 1, net 2,
net l we can do a summation. We can write

177
00:27:43,039 --> 00:28:04,100
this as let me again compact it error of 1,
2, l, and this we can write as summation over

178
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:21,870
l, this index letters call it i d or let us
use l as the index and l we have del e by

179
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:45,059
del net l del net l by del o j. So, this error
is coming from these units and i am taking

180
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:53,519
the summation over that so summation of del
e by del o j del e where it is coming from

181
00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:00,820
this unit. So, we were writing it in chain
form as del e by del net l del net l by del

182
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:09,259
o j. So, for this node we have net 1 and then
o 1, net 2 then o 2, net 3 then o 3, and the

183
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:27,890
output of this contributes to the net 1 contributes
to net 2 contributes to net 3.

184
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:40,030
Now what we can write is that, if we look
at this so we can write this as summation

185
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:54,370
of over l del e by. So, let us look at the
output here, output here is o l. We can write

186
00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:09,350
it as del e by del o l, del o l by del net
l. This part i have expanded to del e by del
