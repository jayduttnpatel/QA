142
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:13,340
this is the unit i. And j has you know initially
the output is net j and then the output is

143
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:24,980
o j. So this is o j and this is o i.
Now, we have decomposed this partial derivative

144
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,809
in these three components. Now what we will
do is that let us remember this and we will

145
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:42,760
do these three computations separately then
we will write them together. So first let

146
00:20:42,760 --> 00:21:02,100
us look at del net j by del w i j, del net
j by del w i j. So what is net j, net j is

147
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:28,880
sigma o i w i j. And so we have del del w
i j sigma of w k j o k equal to 1 to n, so

148
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:44,779
this is equal to o i. Because only here we
have w i j and these other link 1 to n they

149
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:55,809
have nothing to do with i. So, del net j by
del w i j is simply o i. In corresponding

150
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:09,309
to o i only we have w i j, and we have o 1
w 1 j, o 2 w 2 j, o 3 w 3 j they have nothing

151
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:15,789
to do with w i j. So only here we will have
and so this is equal to o i.

152
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:28,360
So, del net j by del w i j this we have this
part we have computed and this a is equal

153
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:41,830
to o i. Let me clean this so that we can work
out the other two components of this expression.

154
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:54,409
Next let us take this second term del o j
by del net j. What is o j? O j equal to phi

155
00:22:54,409 --> 00:23:12,269
of net j, so del del net j we have phi of
net j. We have already seen that this particular

156
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:18,620
derivative will depend on the form of the
activation function if you assume sigmoid

157
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,700
activation function, for sigmoid activation
function we will have this is equal to phi

158
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:42,789
of net j 1 minus phi of net j. So, this is
the second term here which we have computed

159
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:50,980
given like this.
Now, let us look at the third term del e by

160
00:23:50,980 --> 00:24:14,860
del o j. Now we can take the derivative with
respect to o j and we can get recursive expression

161
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:24,309
of the derivative as follows; this is equal
to summation over i. Now first of all let

162
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:38,070
us say that the inputs to this network are
1, 2, 3, 4 up to n, so, let us say z equal

163
00:24:47,640 --> 00:25:00,120
to 1, 2, n these are the inputs to the unit
o j. We can write this as follows; summation i
