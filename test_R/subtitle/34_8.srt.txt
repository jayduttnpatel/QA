291
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:08,440
advance concept like convolutional neural
networks and others, which you can explore

292
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,510
yourself. So, both the motivation behind me
introducing you to TF learn and the larger

293
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,780
and the like the parent of t f learn which
is tensor flow is that just to give you a

294
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,700
heads off in that directions.
So, if you people are enthusiastic about deep

295
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,330
learning if you really want to check out what
the magic is all about, how are machine becoming

296
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,610
really intelligent like as intelligent as
human beings, and beating human beings in

297
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,970
they are own tasks. So, if you want to check
out how deep learning actually works, so this

298
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:48,260
is a very good tool which you can use for
implementing your own algorithms and like

299
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,640
there are a lot of like turn of implementer
algorithms already implementer algorithms.

300
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,570
A lot of resources available for this particular
library, and people are actively and Google

301
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:04,450
is actually actively developing this particular
library. So, you can use this and you know

302
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:12,650
explore the possibilities of deep learning
in your own field. So, I hope you enjoy this

303
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:22,230
video, and I recommend you to take this ahead.
Bye, bye, see you in the next video.
