362
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,740
just to make sure that the next that next
time the validation error is small.

363
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,390
So, in some way this, the machine has seen
the validation data, but it must be evaluated

364
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:19,710
to get a taste of the true error that the
machine would incur when it is deployed in

365
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:26,309
the real world, we must show it some data,
we must evaluate it on this show on some data

366
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:29,619
which it has never seen before and that is
where this test data comes in.

367
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:39,890
So, this comes in and do so I will write here
do final evaluation, so after the system is

368
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,329
completely trained and it is ready to be deployed.

369
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:47,499
We bring in the test data and we check the
performance of the machine on the test data

370
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:53,119
we check the test error and we report it that,
yes, this is an estimate of the true error

371
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,430
that the system is going to incur when it
is deployed.

372
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,940
So the kind of questions that you are going
to face from this section is like you would

373
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,390
be asked to like say whether the training
set is a measure of the true error or the

374
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:14,699
training error is a measure of the true error,
or whether the test error or the validation

375
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:15,779
error are measures of the true error.

376
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:20,430
So, the training error is not at all the measure
of the true error because it is the error

377
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:26,180
that has been you knows incurred by the system
on a set of training examples, which it has

378
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,520
already seen during its training, and it was
improving on that particular set.

379
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,160
Whereas the test data is completely unseen,
so it is the measure of the true error when

380
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,060
it will be deployed in the real world.

381
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,910
And the validation set it gives an estimate
of the generalization performance while the

382
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,449
system is be trained.

383
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:54,029
So, best of luck, all right, go ahead and
solve this weekâ€™s assignment, and the deadline

384
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:59,149
is 27th of July, 11 P.M - Indian Standard
Time all right.

385
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,930
So just go ahead and you will find familiar
questions in this assignment, and solving

386
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,269
this assignment will give you a good understanding
of the topics that have been covered in this

387
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:09,989
course.

388
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:13,169
So, best of luck, bye, bye, see you next time,
peace.
