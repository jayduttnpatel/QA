159
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:14,940
See, the learner takes the experience and
from that it can also take the background

160
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:25,270
knowledge and from this the learner builds
models and this models can be used by the

161
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:31,190
reasoner, which given a task finds the solution
to the task.

162
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:38,169
So, the learner takes experience and background
knowledge and learns a model and the reasoner

163
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:45,630
works with the model and given a new problem
or task, it can come up with the solution

164
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,330
to the task and the performance measure corresponding
to this.

165
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,730
Now, we will like to look at some examples
of machine learning system.

166
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,679
So, machine learning, there are many domains
and applications of machine learning.

167
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:07,370
For example, in medicine you can use machine
learning to diagnose a disease where the input

168
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:14,510
at the symptoms, lab measurements, test results,
DNA tests, etcetera.

169
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:20,309
Output could be one of a set of possible diseases
or none of them.

170
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:29,350
For doing this, one can determine historical
medical records and learn which future patients

171
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,350
will respond best to which treatments.

172
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:40,019
Another domain is computer vision where given
an image; you want to find out what objects

173
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,059
appear in an image and where the objects appear
in an image.

174
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:54,010
A third domain, robot control; one can use
machine learning to design autonomous mobile

175
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,050
robots that learn to navigate from their own
experience.

176
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:09,230
Then, in the domain of natural language processing,
one can detect where entities are mentioned

177
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:17,000
in natural language and detect what facts
are expressed in natural language.

178
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,020
One can look at a product or movie review
and find out if it is positive, negative or

179
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,430
neutral, that is, the sentiment on the review.

180
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,870
Other applications in NLP include speech recognition,
machine translation etcetera.

181
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:43,080
In the financial domain, one can try to predict
if a stock will rise or fall; one can predict

182
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,360
if a user will click on an advertisement or
not.

183
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,830
There are many applications in business intelligence.

184
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,600
You want to robustly forecast product sales
quantities taking seasonality and trend into

185
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,530
account.

186
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:09,110
Identify cross selling promotional opportunities,
identify price sensitivity of a consumer product,

187
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:14,309
and optimize product location at a super market
shelf and so on.

188
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:22,299
Then, there are other applications such as
fraud detection, credit card fraud detection.

189
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:29,850
Understand consumer sentiment, forecast womenâ€™s
conviction rates based on external macroeconomic

190
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,010
factors, etcetera.

191
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,750
So, these are some of the many, many applications
of machine learning.

192
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:43,799
Machine learning is a part of many products
and systems that we routinely use.

193
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:52,360
If you look at the box that we drew for machine
learning systems and discuss how we can go

194
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,020
about creating a learner, these are the following
steps.

195
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:08,220
First of all, we choose the training experience
or the training data.

196
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:24,210
Then, we choose the target function or how
we want to represent the model.

197
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:37,640
So, this is what we want to learn, the target
function that is to be learned.

198
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,610
For example, if you are trying to write a
machine learning system to play the game of

199
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:52,169
checkers, the target function would be, given
a board position, what move to take.

200
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,279
And then, we want to have the class of function
that we will use, the task is given a board

201
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,950
position what move to take and we will design
the function as a function of the input and
