00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,520
Hello friends, welcome to the first tutorial
session of this course.

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,220
I am Anirban Santara, I am doing my PhD in
Machine Learning, and I am a teaching assistant

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,920
of this course.

4
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,640
And in these tutorial sessions, which we will
hold one every week, we will discuss the topics

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,650
that have been covered in the particular week,
and do a quick summary of all the topics that

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,890
have been covered in this week.

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,720
And then, we will learn how to solve questions
and these questions will be the ones that

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,390
you would expect in the assignments and in
the final exams, all right.

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,089
So, in this first tutorial class, we will
be taking the following topics.

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,309
So, let us go ahead.

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:11,229
So, the topics that we will be discussing
today will are supervised and versus unsupervised

12
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,000
learning.

13
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:40,360
Then different kinds of features - categorical
versus continuous features; different kinds

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:49,540
of supervise learning problems - regression
versus classification.

15
00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:02,840
Then we will go ahead to bias variance trade
off -bias versus variance and we will study

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,409
how bias and variance they vary with different
parameters of the learning algorithm.

17
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:15,430
And then we will study how to control, and
how to you know detect and analyze generalization

18
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:27,930
performance - generalization performance of
a learning algorithm of a learning algorithm.

19
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:38,220
So, let us first take up the first topic of
todayâ€™s tutorial class that is supervised

20
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,920
versus unsupervised learning.

21
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:58,310
Supervised versus Unsupervised learning; so
this supervised and unsupervised learning

22
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:05,930
are two major broad categories of the machine
learning algorithms, the only difference,

23
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,290
so whenever you have been given a question,
and asked whether a particular learning algorithm

24
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,330
has been described.

25
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:21,650
So, you have been so there is a big paragraph
describing a particular scenario, and you

26
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,550
have to identify what kind of learning algorithm
is going on in this particular scenario all

27
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,170
right.

28
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,040
So, the first thing, whether it is supervised
or unsupervised, so the first thing that you

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,200
are going to look for is the kind of training
examples that have been presented to you.

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:58,640
So, supervised learning always comes when
wait, so let me first, supervised learning.

31
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:10,220
So, in supervised learning, the training examples
will always come as pairs.

32
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:18,470
So, the pair so these pairs will be the first
term will always be the input, and then you

33
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,930
will have the target value.

34
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:35,600
So, this is the true value and this is the
description of the present case.

35
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:50,060
So, it could be like an image and the true
value may be whether it is happy or sad; so

36
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,520
it is already given that this particular image
describes a happy face.

37
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,880
And so the input examples will always come
as pairs of input and target values.
