128
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:10,730
that is encoded in the belief network.
Unfortunately in general, exact inference

129
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:27,129
is intractable for arbitrary base network.
If have an arbitrary base network the exact

130
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:33,480
inference is intractable. For certain special
types of base network which have some special

131
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,889
structure exact inferences tractable, but
even when exact inferences intractable there

132
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:53,929
are certain methods by which you can do inference
in a tractable type. So, there are approximate

133
00:20:53,929 --> 00:21:05,870
techniques for inference, e g Monte Carlo
methods, we will not talk about these methods

134
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,370
or in fact, any inference method specifically
in this class.

135
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:22,159
These are also can be heard for certain type
Bayesian network, but in practice many of

136
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:41,200
these methods are useful, but you can have
efficient algorithm the leverage the structure

137
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:54,289
of graph. In the last class, we talked about
naive bayes and we said that naive bayes represents

138
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,100
certain independence conditional independence
assumptions. We can draw a naÃ¯ve bayes the

139
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:05,429
probabilities in the variables involved in
naive bayes in this graphical structure and

140
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:11,169
that particular structure inference efficient.
There are other types of structures like poly

141
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:16,440
trees structures which are more general structure
for which inferences efficient, but it is

142
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,009
not true for other structures, but there are
different algorithms for dealing with poly

143
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:31,379
trees and certain variations of poly trees,
but those details we will not talk about in this class

144
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:42,230
Let us look at, what are the situations, what
are some standard situations where we can

145
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:52,320
apply Bayesian network? Bayesian networks
can be applied in many scenarios, for example,

146
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:01,730
it can be applied for diagnosis. Suppose,
you know the symptoms of a disease you want

147
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,950
to identify what is the possible cause.

148
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:30,230
For example, suppose a cancer causes tumor
and then there are other causes for a tumor.

149
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:43,049
A cancer may also cause weight loss and so
on. So, if you are given the symptoms you

150
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:50,190
can try to infer what is the possible cause,
we saw an example of this type of inference

151
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,269
where we looked at using bayes theorem and.
So, from the symptoms you can find out what

152
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:03,250
is probability of the specific causes. So,
if you are late for work what is the probability

153
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:11,230
that there is traffic jam? So, given the symptom
you want to find out what is the possible

154
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:19,499
cause. So, this is for diagnosis you want
to diagnose what happened given that you can

155
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:24,070
see the symptom.
Suppose, some machine is malfunctioning you

156
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:30,889
observe certain things you want to understand,
what is the possible cause this is for diagnosis

157
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:36,659
a bayes network can also be used for prediction.
If you have cancer, what is the probability

158
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:43,779
of weight loss? What is the probability that
you have a tumor? So, it can be used for prediction

159
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:47,259
given the cause, find the probability of the
symptoms?

160
00:24:48,440 --> 00:25:03,230
Bayes network can be used for prediction,
find the probability of class given the training
