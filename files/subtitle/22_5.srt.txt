110
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:17,600
says that so this is the statement of Naive
Bayes the input features are conditionally

111
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:34,450
independent given a target value, so this
is important. So, if you say that I am sure

112
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:41,749
that the target is going to take a particular
value say 0 given that the target has been

113
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:47,279
prefixed to a given value the con the all
the input parameters the input variables or

114
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,499
the input features, it becomes conditionally
independent. So, this is the Naive Bayes assumption.

115
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:06,220
So, how does it look like in the mathematics
side, so this says that suppose the input

116
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:28,159
is described by a future vector X, which is
a vector x 1, x 2 till x n, and where x i

117
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:57,090
is i equal to 1 through n are different input
features. So, let the output or target variable

118
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:05,789
be Y.
Then probability of X this vector given a

119
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:14,860
particular value of Y, it is going to be so
all the variable, so what is this, so this

120
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,059
is basically a co-occurrence of all of these
random variables, for A joint probability

121
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:34,269
distributions of all of these random variables.
So, this can be approximated as a product

122
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:41,139
of the conditioner probability distributions
of each of these features given the value

123
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:49,570
of Y. So, i equal to 1 through n p of x i
given Y equal to y. So, you assumed that all

124
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,820
of these input features become conditionally
independent when a particular value of the

125
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:01,200
target variable is given, so this is the Naive
Bayes assumption. It is very helpful in certain

126
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:10,700
scenarios, but often is not right to assume
Naive Bayes assumption.

127
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:27,570
Yes, so what kind of problems can come from
this section, you will be given a certain

128
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:35,960
scenario. So, maybe you have already seen
the hands on exercise python exercise, and

129
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,090
there we used Naive Bayes assumption to classify
emails as spam or non spam. There we had assumed

130
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:50,029
at given Y equal to say now let us take up
that problem again. So, what kind of assumption

131
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:58,239
was done there in that case so in our so if
you have miss this video then go ahead and

132
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:05,669
look at assignment or like exercise, hands
on exercise number 3 or week 4 hands on exercise

133
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:11,220
as will be easier for you to find out in the
course website. So, we are going to take up

134
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,360
that example again and we consider it for
a moment.

135
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:38,440
In our spam classification example, each email
was described as a vector of Xâ€™s where sorry

136
00:24:38,440 --> 00:25:04,830
where each x i was a word which is significant
in deciding spam or non spam so given that
