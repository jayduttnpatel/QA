00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,830
Good morning.

2
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:28,720
So, today we will start the second part of
the module introduction to linear regression

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,000
and decision tress.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
In todayâ€™s lecture we will give a brief
introduction to decision trees.

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:44,770
In the last class we saw, we talked about
linear regression, which learns the linear function

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,390
The learning algorithm, that we will start
today, the representation is a decision tree,

7
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,530
which is a non-linear function.

8
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,519
So, first let us define what is a decision
tree?

9
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:08,029
I hope all of you know what is a computer
science tree.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,220
A tree has nodes and branches.

11
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:25,860
A rooted tree, you have a root node and you
have children and then you have leafs, which

12
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,250
do not have any children.

13
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,390
Now, a decision tree is a tree, is also a
classifier.

14
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:43,060
A decision tree is a classifier in the form
of a tree and the tree has two types of nodes,

15
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,180
decision nodes, so is a classifier.

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:05,460
It is a tree structured classifier, which
is tree structured and it has two types of

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,849
nodes, decision nodes and leaf nodes.

18
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:26,030
So, in decision nodes they specify a choice
or a test based on this you can decide which

19
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,520
direction you can go.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,700
So, in a decision tree we test something and
that test may have more than one result and

21
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,390
the based on the value of this test, you either
follow this branch or this branch.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:50,549
So, this test is usually done on the value
of a feature or attribute of the instance.

23
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,689
So, test is on some attribute and there is
a branch for each outcome.

24
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:01,200
So, there may be two outcomes or in some cases,
you can have more than two outcome.

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
And then, there are leaf nodes.

26
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:14,840
So, leaf node indicate the classification
of an example or the value of the example.

27
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,099
Decision trees can be used both for classification
and regression.

28
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,379
However, it is more popularly used for classification
though they can be used for regression also.

29
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:37,659
So, given an example, you start with the root
of the tree and based on the value, based

30
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:43,889
on the value of the test you go to the corresponding
branch and you continue doing this until you

31
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,450
come to a leaf node, and at the leaf node
you have the value of the example.

32
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,209
It can be the predicted value of the example
for classification, regression or it can be

33
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,209
a probability.

34
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,509
So, let us make it clearer by drawing an example
decision tree.

35
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,120
So, let us say, we want to draw a decision
tree about whether to approve a loan.

36
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:25,570
So, let us say, the first test that we will
make is check if the applicant is employed.

37
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:37,630
So, this is a decision node and we test whether
the applicant is employed and there are two

38
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,710
outcomes, no or yes.

39
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:50,920
If the applicant is not employed, then we
have another test, we check the credit score

40
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,780
of the applicant.

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,600
Does he have a high credit score?

42
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:12,720
Now, if the credit score is high, then you
approve the loan and if the credit score is
